# MNSIT-data-This is a Python Program using Machine learning in Tenser flow
he dataset is called MNIST and refers to handwritten digit recognition. You can find more about it on Yann LeCun's website (Director of AI Research, Facebook). He is one of the pioneers of what we've been talking about and of more complex approaches that are widely used today, such as covolutional neural networks (CNNs).

The dataset provides 70,000 images (28x28 pixels) of handwritten digits (1 digit per image).

The goal is to write an algorithm that detects which digit is written. Since there are only 10 digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), this is a classification problem with 10 classes.

Our goal would be to build a neural network with 2 hidden layers.
